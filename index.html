    <h1>Hi, I'm Emil!</h1>

    <img id="Emil_Utrecht" src="images/Emil_Utrecht.jpg" />

    <p>I'm a mathematician, data scientist, and aspiring game developer. I like building things for their usefulness, to
        learn, or just for the fun of it. Most of the times, any approach I choose leads to the other two!</p>

    <p>Previously I worked as an R&D Algorithms Engineer at Continental developing algorithms for computer perception
        using LiDAR, RADAR, and camera. Here I learned to work in an agile team </p>

    <p>Currently, I'm working on creating a videogame on my own. That means I need to learn all about music, art,
        programming, and design.</p>

    <p>As you can see, this website is still on development. Nonetheless, in the near future, on this website you will
        find my interests, what I've learned, or some of the projects I've worked on. </p>
