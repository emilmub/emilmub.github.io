                    <h1>Hi, I'm Emil!</h1>

                    <p>I'm a mathematician, data scientist, and aspiring game developer. I like building things for
                        their
                        usefulness, to
                        learn, or just for the fun of it. Most of the times, any approach I choose leads to the other
                        two!
                    </p>

                    <p>Previously I worked as an R&D Algorithms Engineer at Continental developing algorithms for
                        computer
                        perception
                        using LiDAR, RADAR, and camera. Here I learned to work in an agile team </p>

                    <p>Currently, I'm working on creating a videogame on my own. That means I need to learn all about
                        music,
                        art,
                        programming, and design.</p>

                    <p>As you can see, this website is still on development. Nonetheless, in the near future, on this
                        website
                        you
                        will
                        find my interests, what I've learned, or some of the projects I've worked on. </p>
