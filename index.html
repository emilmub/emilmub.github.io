    <h1>Hi, I'm Emil!</h1>

    <p>I'm a mathematician, data scientist, and aspiring game developer. I like building things for their usefulness, to
        learn or just for the fun of it. Most of the times, any approach leads to the other two!</p>

    <p>Currently, I'm working on creating a videogame on my own. That means I need to learn all about music, art,
        programming, and design</p>

    <p>On this website you will find my interests, what I've learned, or some of the projects I've worked on. </p>
