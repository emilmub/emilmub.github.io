                    <h1>About me</h1>
                    <p>Hello, I'm Emil! I am a software developer aspiring to create a videogame. I like being
                        fully involved in whichever project I'm working on in order to take informed decisions and make
                        feasible plans.</p>

                    <p>The biggest project I've participated in was for Continental, where we were looking to develop
                        algorithms for object detection in the path of a vehicle using a LiDAR sensor for autonomous
                        driving. Here I worked as a KPI analyst, algorithms engineer, and even as Scrum Master for my
                        team.</p>

                    <p>Currently, I'm working on creating a video game. For this, I learned Unity and programming in C#,
                        which has gone really great! I'm also learning about musical composition and I have never felt
                        as comfortable with my guitar as I do now. Additionally, I started my web dev path to gather and
                        share my projects and things I have learned along the way.</p>

                    <p>Outside of work, I have been getting to know the world with my wonderful partner, who has
                        supported me in all my endeavors. Also, in my free time, I like playing videogames, reading,
                        building fun stuff on Python, playing my guitar, and hanging out with friends.</p>
